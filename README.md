# DSA-1
This is my space where I practice DSA
From Basic concepts to implementations, this repository tracks my learning journey and explorations of Data Structures and Algorithms.  

### Topics Covered:  
- Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Circular Queues  
- Stack/Queues using Lists  
- Singly & Doubly Linked Lists  
- Binary Search Tree (BST), Red-Black Tree, Trie
- Min heap , Max heap 
- Recursion  
- Unordered Maps

## What You'll Find Here  
ðŸ”¹ My DSA implementations & optimizations  
ðŸ”¹ Code snippets & solutions  
ðŸ”¹ Functions/operations on various data structures
